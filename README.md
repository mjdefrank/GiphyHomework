Homework 6 AJAX &amp; Giphy
Click the buttons to pull 10 still gifs of popular comedy shows from the Giphy API. Click on each of the gifs to animate or pause the gifs.  If you don't see your favorite show, use the search bar to add a program.  The page uses Materialize CSS and is semi-responsive; "semi" only because the gifs are being returned in their smallest format.  When the viewport is in the "small" range, the 10 gifs typically exceed the borders of the retro TV screen .png photo.
